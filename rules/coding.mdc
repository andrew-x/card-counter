- Every component file must start with either `use client` or `use server` as appropriate.
- Adopt React Server Components and SSR (App Router) where possible; limit "use client" to UI interactions.
- Never use `any` unless unavoidable; prefer strong and explicit types.
- Use semantic HTML tags when possible.
- Always adhere to Eslint and Prettier rules.
