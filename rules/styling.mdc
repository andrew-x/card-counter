- Use Tailwind utility classes for layout and design, Mantine UI for complex components.
- Prefer mobile-first responsive design.
- For Mantine: theme overrides and customization should live in `/styles/mantine-theme.ts` or similar.
- Do not mix custom CSS and Tailwind unless necessary.
- When using both Mantine and Tailwind together, prefer Mantine for base components and Tailwind for additional layout refinement.
